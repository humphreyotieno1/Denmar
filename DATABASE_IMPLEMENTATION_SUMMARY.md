If new → Create new subscriber record
    ↓
Generate unique unsubscribe token
    ↓
Send welcome email (with unsubscribe link)
Send team notification

## 📊 Viewing Your Data

### Option 1: phpPgAdmin (Recommended)
1. Login to cPanel
2. Click "phpPgAdmin" (or PostgreSQL Databases → Manage)
3. Select your database
4. Browse tables:
   - `newsletter_subscribers`
   - `contact_submissions`

### Option 2: SQL Queries

**Active subscribers:**
```sql
SELECT email, "subscribedAt" 
FROM newsletter_subscribers 
WHERE status = 'active' 
ORDER BY "subscribedAt" DESC;
```

**Recent contact submissions:**
```sql
SELECT name, email, country, "submittedAt" 
FROM contact_submissions 
ORDER BY "submittedAt" DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

**Subscriber count:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total 
FROM newsletter_subscribers 
WHERE status = 'active';
```

**Export emails for marketing:**
```sql
SELECT email 
FROM newsletter_subscribers 
WHERE status = 'active';
```
